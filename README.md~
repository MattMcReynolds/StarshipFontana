# Airplane Fontana #

This is an example C++ application using the SDL library.
It tries to be as nicely C++11 as possible but do keep in
mind that SDL is written in C and, at some stage, you have
to interface with it.

## Story ##
On a remote island west of England, the land of Ire sees 
itself under heavy attack from an unknown band of planes. 
They also don't like pigeons. In this breif-but-epic 
attle, fight off the oncoming planes before the base is 
hit and your country falls into chaos. 

## Installation ##
You will have to have the SDL development libraries installed on
your system.  The easiest way to compile is to use a command-line

```bash
$ g++ -c -std=c++11 src/*.cpp
$ g++ -o StarshipFontana *.o -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image
```

which will produce an executable file called "starship" in the
top-level directory.  To execute this file do the following

`$ ./StarshipFontana`
 
from the top-level directory.  The game will expect to find the
`assets` directory under its current working directory.

## Credits ##
All of the sprites in the game were made by me using GIMP 2.8
